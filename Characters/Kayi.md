  <p>Kayi is the deposed Princess of Icefall Keep, the capital of Serrata Peaks and sole heir to the throne. Forced to flee her home after a palace coup, the sheltered Kayi is adjusting to her new, chaotic life in the flatlands of Crater. She hopes to one day recruit her fellow competitors and battle the villains who hijacked her kingdom and imprisoned her family. Kayi is a technical competitor with a Charged Bolt weapon, Snow Globe power and Grappling Hook.</p>

  <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>KAYI grew up in ICEFALL KEEP, the capital of SERRATA PEAKS, an isolated kingdom known for its frozen temperatures and vertiginous mountains. As the realm’s Princess, she is by turns naïve and haughty, vulnerable and strong.</p>
  <p>Kayi is bona fide royalty, but if she ever confided her feelings, she’d tell you that sitting in the lap of luxury offered little comfort. She received a rigorous education, heavy on the sciences and light on pleasure or leisure. She took classes from dawn to dusk, and again from dinnertime to bedtime. One of the things Kayi learned was how to rappel down the walls of Icefall Keep, a survival skill that first helped her escape her studies for a time, but later helped her escape when her family’s fortunes went sour overnight.</p>
  <p>Serrata Peaks is rich in mineral resources, but her family wanted to keep them in the ground. The Kingdom’s greedy ADVISORY COMMITTEE felt otherwise, and staged a sudden, silent coup to assume control. Her parents “disappeared,” and Kayi may have met the same fate were it not for her mountaineering expertise. After her perilous decent, she found refuge in the warmer, but for her, far lonelier regions below.</p>
  <p>Kayi may look like a pampered royal, but she’s tough. She left the mountaintop with a cache of personalized weapons including her GRAPPLING HOOK and its retractable ZIP LINE, which gets her in and out of situations with a piercing WHIZZ!. Her CHARGED BOLTS are precision projectiles with a time-delayed trigger that can puncture any surface. And her Special Attack, the SNOW GLOBE, creates an ICY SPHERE that slows down opponents and their rockets to help her evade the latter and explode the former as, while inside the Sphere, Kayi’s Bolts fire faster and hit harder.</p>
