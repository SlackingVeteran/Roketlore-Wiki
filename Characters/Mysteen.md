  <p>Mysteen is a mystical Illusionist who uses the art of misdirection and slight of hand to take center stage from the competition that awes the audience. She's equipped with rocket-cards that have a 3 round burst on every third consecutive shot, a mirror-shield that protects againsts enemy rockets, and a phantasm-double that mimics her actions which also can swap places with its owner indefinitely during its duration.</p>

  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>There's not much known about the mysterious Miss Mavarak. Enigmatic indeed, from the region of Conjura, her motive for joining the tour is left in secrecy.. Some spectators say that if you pay close attention to Miss Mavvy's performances you may uncover a thing or two; but shhhh keep it on the hush hush, Sugar...</p>
