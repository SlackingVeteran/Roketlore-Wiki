  <p>Mysteen is a mystical Illusionist who uses the art of misdirection and slight of hand to take center stage from the competition that awes the audience. She's equipped with rocket-cards that have a 3 round burst on every third consecutive shot, a mirror-shield that protects againsts enemy rockets, and a phantasm-double that mimics her actions which also can swap places with its owner indefinitely during its duration.</p>
