  <p>Jayto Keen is bright, but a bit bumbling. He won last year's trophy with a lucky shot. His swagger is compensation for a flop-sweat feeling that he didn't deserve to win. This time, the bright and brash young man is determined to win fair-and-square and remove the asterisk from beside his name. He hopes to emulate Boom City's famous Champion, Berno Boom.</p>

  <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The bright and brash Jayto Keen currently represents BOOM CITY in the Tour, and is the youngest player to ever win the Tour Trophy. Heading into this year’s contest, he is the one to beat… if he doesn’t sabotage himself first. Jayto showed great skill last time, using his SKYPIERCER ROCKETS, ROCKET SWARM, and THRUSTER SUIT to great advantage. But in the end, he became champion through sheer luck.</p>
  <p>Another competitor, Amphora, was handily outfighting Jayto. She swamped him with a waterspout, and was one torpedo strike away from securing the trophy for herself. Jayto, struggling to retaliate, drew his Rocket Swarmer Launcher – and lost his grip in the swirl of Amphora’s maelstrom. When the errant weapon hit the ground it launched a swarm of Mini-Rockets straight upward, seemingly missing their target. Amphora was too busy making jokes at Jayto’s expense to look up and notice the runaways reaching their peak and running out of fuel. They tumbled back down on her and before you could say “Boomity-Boom-Bam!” Amphora was sent flying from the arena and KO’d. Jayto limped away with the Trophy in his hand… and an asterisk by his name to go with his wounded pride.</p>
 <p>That is why Jayto has a lot to prove – not only to the Tour fans, but also to himself. His swaggering, wink-to-the-camera attitude is an act, overcompensation for a flop-sweat fear that he didn’t deserve to win, as some members of the Crater’s Gossiping Class believe. “Next time,” they whisper, “a real Champion will get the Trophy.”</p>
