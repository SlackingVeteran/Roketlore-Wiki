  <h2>Story</h2>
    <p></p>
  <p>Izell the Fearless serves as champion of the GEMSTONE JUNGLE, a verdant region known for its troves of precious jewels and myriad dangers. Hers is an ancient culture; its origins are lost in the mists of time, but it predates the creation of Crater in its current configuration. The region was once the home of the Jaaqua, a long-extinct apex predator and Crater’s version of Earth’s big cats – lions, tigers, jaguars, etc.</p>
  <p>A warning to those who enter the jungle harboring any sense of superiority: you dismiss the indigenous population as “primitive” at your peril. Exhibit A: Izell is a fierce warrior, unmatched in hand-to-hand combat, who uses a Jaaqua-inspired martial arts style developed by her forebears. The Spear she carries is no mere pointy stick, it is a weapon that launches a variety of munitions – SPEAR ROCKETS, obviously, but also the BOLA SNARE, which ensnare her opponents and drags them toward her, so she can then unleash her JAAQUA CHARGE, a debilitating release of stored Gemstone Energy.</p>
  <p>Izell is a fierce competitor who has been training for the Tour since she was a child. Strong, speedy and stealthy, she can outrun and outmaneuver nearly any adversary. She’s a great addition to any team; no one will work harder to win than she. But when you partner with her, understand that Izell doesn’t play well with others. Adhere to her strategy and things will go fine. If another competitor has a better idea, she will grumble, grouse, and begrudgingly go along... and only admit the plan “wasn’t bad” long after it succeeds.</p>
