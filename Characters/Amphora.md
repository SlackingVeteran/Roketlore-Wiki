  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>Amphora was born in an underwater world full of submarines and shimmering stones known as Crystal Reef. She was raised by her indulgent parents and their fellow scientists. Her ability to turn into liquid being is a mystery to herself. Growing up next to mysterious Star of Crater might have something to do with her abilities.</p>
  <p>Once you get past her glam and glitter, you will discover that she is sharp minded and a penchant of painful puns. Amphora is a explorer who wants to learn the origin and secrets of the Star of Crater and understand more about its mysterious glowing energy which could maybe reveal how she came to have the ability to turn into watery sea creature</p>
